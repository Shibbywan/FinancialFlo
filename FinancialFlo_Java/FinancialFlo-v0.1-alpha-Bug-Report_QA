FinancialFlo v0.1-alpha Bug Report_QA

Improvements to be made
1. Add Autocomplete and autocorrect, e.g. if typing kimberl -> autofill to Kimberly-Clark
2. Formatting- Bold company stock symbols, adding borders to cells
3. Highlight (e.g. green for highest) best statistics, e.g. PG has higher Market cap than KMB.
4. Remove requirement of excel, compact program into one package
5. When highlighting over each category (e.g. Beta), provide brief description/definition


Bugs
1. Program does nothing when a non-existent symbol is inputted
2. Excel spreadsheet output in wrong order, see http://imgur.com/1DXGRnS. We want Symbol in top row
3. Excel spreadsheet output is missing Company name e.g. for KMB, we want to show Kimberly Clark
4. All stock symbols should be capitalized
