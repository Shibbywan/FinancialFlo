The idea is to create a comprehensive investment application in Java. The program will initially be desktop based, although will require an internet connection to fetch new data. A user should be able to search by Company name or Company Code and obtain information such as Net Income, Total Revenue, Stock Price, and Total Assets. The application should include a management system for the user to edit that can be sorted etc.

Future plans include adding a "similar company" function for every company. That company (or companies) will have similar Net Income/Stock price (or other variables idk) and will give the user a gateway to similar companies that may be interesting. Another feature that can be added later is a list of companies that will show on the home page that have dramatically increased/decreased in stock price or another variable to be decided on later.
