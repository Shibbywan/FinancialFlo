Base Idea:

Users of the app within a certain radius (say 10km) take pictures and upload it to a public server which displays the pictures 
only to users within prescribed area.

Users can like/dislike photos and or comment on them

Pictures will stay alive for only 12 hours (or have diminishing return)
----

Possible GUI:
Reddit style upvote/downvote images
or
Interactive Mapping: more popular images are more enlarged, less popular/disliked images become smaller
The longer the image stays, the smaller it becomes, popular images will be pushed to the top? Will need an algorithm/testing to
see the best combination



Extra Ideas: add controversial section, most commented on image, etc.,

Monetization possibilities: display some ads as pictures in between other images.

premium upgrade: allows videos (Or whole new seperate app for that)
