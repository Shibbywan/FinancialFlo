Base Idea:

Users of the app within a certain radius (say 10km) take pictures and upload it to a public server which displays the pictures 
only to users within prescribed area.

Users can like/dislike photos and or comment on them

Pictures will stay alive for only 12 hours (or have diminishing return)
----

Possible GUI:
Reddit style upvote/downvote images
or
Interactive Mapping: more popular images are more enlarged, less popular/disliked images become smaller




Extra Ideas: add controversial section, most commented on image, etc.,
