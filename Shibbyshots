Base Idea:

Users of the app within a certain radius (say 10km) take pictures and upload it to a public server which displays the pictures 
only to users within prescribed area.

Users can like/dislike photos and or comment on them

Pictures will stay alive for only 12 hours (or have diminishing return)
